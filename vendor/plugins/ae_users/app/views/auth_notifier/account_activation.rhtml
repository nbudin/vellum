Dear <%=@name%>,

Thank you for signing up for an account on <%=@server_name%>!  There's just one more
step you need to do before you can use it: we need you to verify that this email address
belongs to you.

To do that, simply go to:

<%= url_for :only_path => false, :controller => "account", :action => "activate", :account => @account.id, :activation_key => @account.activation_key, :escape => false%>

Thanks again for signing up!

- The Management
