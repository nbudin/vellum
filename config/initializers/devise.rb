  # (requires mongo_ext installed) and :data_mapper (experimental).
  require 'devise/orm/active_record'

  # "sessions/users/new". It's turned off by default because it's slower if you
  # are using only default views.
  # config.scoped_views = true

  # By default, devise detects the role accessed based on the url. So whenever
  # accessing "/users/sign_in", it knows you are accessing an User. This makes
  # routes as "/sign_in" not possible, unless you tell Devise to use the default
  # scope, setting true below.
  # config.use_default_scope = true

  # Configure the default scope used by Devise. By default it's the first devise
  # role declared in your routes.

  # If you want to use other strategies, that are not (yet) supported by Devise,
  # you can configure them inside the config.warden block. The example below
  # allows you to setup OAuth, using http://github.com/roman/warden_oauth
  #
  # config.warden do |manager|
  #   manager.oauth(:twitter) do |twitter|
  #     twitter.consumer_secret = <YOUR CONSUMER SECRET>
  #     twitter.consumer_key  = <YOUR CONSUMER KEY>
  #     twitter.options :site => 'http://twitter.com'
  #   end
  #   manager.default_strategies(:scope => :user).unshift :twitter_oauth
  # end
